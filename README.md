# Fright Before Christmas

Welcome to Max Li's *Fright Before Christmas Clone*, a full-featured, blazing-fast python3/pyglet clone of Cartoon Network's browser game, [*Fright Before Christmas*](www.gamegape.com/en-1812-the-fright-before-christmas.html).

## Game Instructions

*Note that there is an issue to set up an instruction screen. In the meantime, please read this first...*

**Goal**: Defeat the enemies that are attacking the semi-circle **force field barrier** in the bottom-middle of the screen.

The game starts immediately on a **battle level**. Here, you can take one of two general actions: press the spacebar or click in the screen (at least at a small distance away from the character in the bottom-middle).

In a battle level, you **press spacebar** to switch characters. The girl attacks brutally to dominate the enemy hordes and the scientist uses strategic buffs when in a pinch. The other guy, who is bald, is supposed to collect coins but for now he doesn't do anything. **Click at enemies** to use the abilities of the girl and the scientist.

After every battle level, when all the enemies have been defeated, you can **buy items at the stop** to help you beat the enemies. Read the description and click the item to make a purchase. For now, since there is no coin-collecting mechanism, the amount you earn per level will be the same.
