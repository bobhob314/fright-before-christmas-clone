fright-before-christmas-clone Introduction
=====================
fright-before-christmas-clone is a clone of the online game "Fright Before Christmas" that can be played here: http://www.gamegape.com/en-1812-the-fright-before-christmas.html. It has a game mode where the characters attack enemies, use buffs to up their advantage, and collect in-game currency. It also has a store mode where players can upgrade their gear. It is dependent on python3, pygame and pyglet for python3. fright-before-christmas-clone was written my Max Li as a Grade 12 Computer Science final project.

User Guide
==========
Run `python3 test.py` and the game starts immediately. Click on the enemies to perform actions aimed towards them. Press the spacebar to switch characters. The girl performs attacks, the balding scientist improves the team with buffs, and the bald guy collects coins. In the store screen, you can read about new abilities and purchase them! Beat the game by beating all the enemies in all the levels, or face irredeemable loss...
